    <td><h3>Download and Install R</h3>
      Precompiled binary distributions of the base system and
      contributed packages, <strong>Windows and
      Mac</strong> users most likely want one of these versions of R:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="bin/linux/">Download R for Linux</a></li>
	  <li><a href="bin/macosx/">Download R for (Mac) OS X</a>
	  <li><a href="bin/windows/">Download R for Windows</a></li>
	</ul>
    R is part of many Linux distributions, you should check with your Linux package management system in addition to the link above.

    <td><h3>Source Code for all Platforms</h3>
      Windows and Mac users most likely want to download the
      precompiled binaries listed in the upper box, not the source
      code. The sources have to be compiled before you can use
      them. If you do not know what this means, you probably do not
      want to do it!

<h2>What are R and CRAN?</h2>

<p> R is &lsquo;GNU S&rsquo;, a freely available language and environment for
statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of
statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling,
statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering,
etc. Please consult the <a href="https://www.R-project.org/"
target="_top">R project homepage</a> for further information.
</p>

<p> CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that
store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for
R. Please use the CRAN <a
href="mirrors.html">mirror</a> nearest to you to minimize network
load.
